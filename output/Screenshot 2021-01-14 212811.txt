The government has suggested it is delaying the requirement for travellers to England to

have a negative coronavirus test to soften the impact of the move on businesses.

Late on Wednesday night, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said the new rule would
come into force on Monday at 4am instead of Friday as planned.

Asked to explain the delay for a move that was signalled last week, the safeguarding

minister, Victoria Atkins, said it was for economic reasons.

Speaking to Sky News, she said: “There's a very delicate balancing act here between
controlling the virus but also ensuring that we are not putting too mụuch of a burden on

the economy.”

She added: “We have listened to the concerns that many people had about whether the
message has quite got through to people who are making the flights over the weekend,

and we have acted in relation to those concerns.”
